::: details What happens when I log in?

While we are loggin you in, we are storing your authorization information locally under `~/.zephyr` in your root directly. Whenever you want to clean up your local profile information (they are JWT claims for each of the project you deployed through Zephyr), you can enter your root directory in terminal and run:

```bash
rm rf ~/.zephyr
```
