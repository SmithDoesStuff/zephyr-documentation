# Configure Cloudflare on Zephyr

Started as an email spam tracker, Cloudflare today offers extensive ability to help users register, manage their domain as a registrar and monitor, secure, configure user's entire IT infrastructure.

In this section we will walk you through how to configure Cloudflare as your default cloud provider to deploy and version your application with Zephyr Cloud, using Cloudflare's global edge network, KV namespace, Workers & Pages project to deliver your content on the edge. 

## Pre-requisites

:::info 

- A registered Cloudflare account 
- A domain registered on Cloudflare, or a domain DNS can be modified by Cloudflare 
- A registered Zephyr Account

:::


## Configure and enable Cloudflare
<Steps> 
### Log in to Zephyr dashboard 
<a href="https://app.zephyr-cloud.io">
<Button variant="outline" className=" hover:bg-zinc-100 hover:text-black">Dashboard</Button>
</a>
After sign in, click on your selected organization. 
<br/>

### Find Cloudflare under Deployment Integration

- Select **Settings** under organization on top navigation tabs.
- On the left side, select **Deployment Integration**.
- Choose **Available** to find Cloudflare and click on **Add integraiton**.

### How to get credentials and configure Cloudflare

Before you move to the next step, you will need two details and one DNS configuration from Cloudflare:

**1. Zone ID**

- On domain's **Overview** tab, scroll down until you can see **API** on the right side bar.
- You will find **Zone ID** under the API section.

**2. API token**

- Under Zone ID and Account ID within the API section, _right click_ on **Get your API token** to _open it on a new tab_.
- Scroll down to the bottom and select **Create Custom Token** by clicking on "Get started".
- Give your API token a meaningfull name (who created this, what's this for etc).
- The configuration needed for API tokens are under **Permissions** (only these are _required_):

| Resource |   Resource Type   | Permission |
| :------- | :---------------: | :--------: |
| Account  | Worker KV Storage |    Edit    |
| Account  |  Worker Scripts   |    Edit    |
| Account  | Cloudflare Pages  |    Edit    |
| Zone     |   Worker Routes   |    Edit    |

- **Zone Resources**: When asked to whether include a specific zone to this API token, you to **Include** a **Specific zone** under your **domain**.

- The rest of configuration details (Account resources, Client IP Address Filtering etc.) are not required by us and you can leave them as default.
- Scroll to bottom to select **Continue to summary** to confirm if the configurations are correct and then **Create Token**, you will see your token on the next page.

**3. Configure your DNS record**


- Go back to your domain's home page (hope that **Overview** page is still opened at this point) and click on **DNS** on left side panel.
- Click on **Add record** on _Records_ page and add below details:

| Type |      Name      |  IPv4 Address  | Proxy status | TTL  |
| :--: | :------------: | :------------: | :----------: | :--: |
|  A   |       *       | `99.83.190.102` |   Proxied    | Auto |
|  A   | `<domain.com>` | `99.83.190.102` |   Proxied    | Auto |

- Note: The **Name** field should be a wild card record as that's needed for serverless workers.

### How to test it{' '}

Navigate to our [recipes](/recipes) to try one of the application, you should see your next deployment deployed through your designated domain! (if not come [talk to us](https://zephyr-cloud.io/discord))

</Steps>

:::note What will be created on your Cloudflare account?

After you add Cloudflare as your cloud provider on Zephyr, several properties will be modified and added on your Cloudflare account.

1. KV Namespaces

Three namespaces will be added:

- ze_snapshots
- ze_files
- ze_env

2. Workers

- `ze-worker-for-static-upload` (used for uploading and serving assets)

3. Worker routes

- `ze.<domain.com>/*` on worker `ze-worker-for-static-upload`
- `*-ze.<domain.com>/*` on worker `ze-worker-for-static-upload`

:::

### Deployment and inspecting assets

Once you finish your first deployment on Cloudflare, you can inspect your assets on Cloudflare.

Navigate to your cloudflare account's main dashboard page, you can click on **Workers & Pages** and then **KV** to inspect your assets by clicking on **View** next to `ze_files`.

:::info


- `ze_files` stores your actual assets.
- `ze_envs` stores you application's environment, access right etc.
- `ze_snapshot` stores your application's snapshots comparing against previous build.
- If you are deploying an application that's previously deployed through our managed cloud, you will need to run `rm -rf ~/.zephyr` before deployment.
- If you faced issues while deploying Micro-frontend application, you can follow your complete guide on [how to deploy Micro-frontend applications on Zephyr](/how-to/mf-guide).
