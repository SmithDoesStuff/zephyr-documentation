# `application_uid` missing

- Error Code: `ZE10017`

- Location: Terminal

- Related plugins: all

Related error: [ZE20012 - `application_uid` is required](/guide/error/ze20012)


After generating your `application_uid` based on your git config and `package.json`, we save them to your local disk in a folder named `~/.zephyr` and we utilize the information there to help you deploy your applications. Each one of your application has their own unique `application_uid`.

Whenever your are using our plugins - be it [zephyr-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zephyr-webpack-plugin), [vite-plugin-zephyr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-zephyr) or [rollup-plugin-zephyr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-zephyr), the first thing we do when you try to run a build is to check whether there is local configurations exists for thie project to run a build. Your project's unique `application_uid` is how we connect with edge URL and finishing your deployment process. 

If the local configuration doesn't exists, we then won't be able to generate a `build id` unique to each of your build. Note that in some scenario you might still be able to run a build - but your deployed url might show you [DE20012 - `application_uid` is required](/guide/error/ze20012).

## Debugging the error

1. Make sure you have a valid `package.json` file (by valid, we mean it fits json format, include name and version) sits in where your bundler configuration is. 

Related error and potential resolution:
- [ZE10010 - `package.json` not found](/guide/error/ze10010)
- [ZE10011 - `package.json` is not a valid json format](/guide/error/ze10011)
- [ZE10012 - `package.json` must have a name and version field](/guide/error/ze10012)

2. Make sure you have git remote origin url, git username, email configured. 

Related error and potential resolution:
- [ZE10014 - Git remote origin is not configured properly](/guide/error/ze10014)
- [ZE10015 - Git username or email is not configured](/guide/error/ze10015)
- [ZE10016 - Could not get git info](/guide/error/ze10016)

3. Remove your local configuration files `~/.zephyr` and login from either [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) or [sidepanel on Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn) again.

rm -rf ~/.zephyr
```
