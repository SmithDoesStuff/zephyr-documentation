# Could not initialize Zephyr Agent

- Error Code: `ZE10020`

- Location: Terminal

- Related plugins: Rollup

On your build start, there are a list of actions we run through. If any of these actions failed, Zephyr agent will fail to initialize in the Rollup plugin.

<dt>1. Understanding environment</dt>
<dd>Git info, package.json's information.</dd>
<dt>2. Application configuration</dt>
<dd>Application configuration including your remote modules, build id and assets.</dd>

## Debugging the error (Possible resolutions)

1. Make sure you have a valid `package.json` file

Package.json should be in json format, include name and version) sits in the same directory as your bundler configuration. A typical project structure Zephyr would understand would be similar to below set up, where each application has their unique name in package.json.

```txt
- HostAppDir
  - package.json 
    - name: "host-app"
    - version: "1.0.0"
  - webpack.config.js
- RemoteAppDir
  - package.json
    - name: "remote-app"
    - version: "1.0.0"
  - webpack.config.js
```

- [ZE10011 - `package.json` is not a valid json format](/guide/error/ze10011)
- [ZE10012 - `package.json` must have a name and version field](/guide/error/ze10012)

2. Make sure you have git remote origin url, git username, email configured.

Related error and potential resolution:

- [ZE10014 - Git remote origin is not configured properly](/guide/error/ze10014)
- [ZE10015 - Git username or email is not configured](/guide/error/ze10015)
- [ZE10016 - Could not get git info](/guide/error/ze10016)

3. Build tool configuration

Your remote modules' configuration should be in a typical format Zephyr understands. For example:

```ts
  plugins: [
    new CopyRspackPlugin({
      patterns: [{
        from: './src/index.html',
        to: './index.html'
      }]
    }),
    new ModuleFederationPluginV1({
      name: 'app_04',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './App': './src/main.js',
        './loadApp': './src/loadApp.js',
      },
      shared: [],
    }),
  ],
```

4. Remove your local configuration file

Remove `~/.zephyr` by running below commands and login from either [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) or [sidepanel on Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn) again.

```

rm -rf ~/.zephyr
```
