# Failed to get application hash list

Whenever we are deploying your application, we save a hash of your application to your local cache, while also comparing your application's current hashed asset to previous build and updating your deployment based on the differences in Key-Value namespaces. 

If your `application_ui` or `build_id` in your local configuration doesn't align with previous build, or you have network request issue, or the integrity of previous hash has been tainted (say you go inside your `~/.zephyr` folder and "accidently" edited some data), they are all plausible reason that you are unable to get application hash list during deployment. 


## Debugging the error

1. Network request error 

If you are in an area have fickle internet connection (you can test it on [fast.com](https://fast.com/)), do make sure you deploy again while your internet connection gets better (minimum over 60Mbps).  


2. Remove configuration file 

If the hashed asset key-value pair are unmatched, the easiest way is to remove your `~/.zephyr` folder in root directory and run the build again.
