# `package.json` is not a valid json file in current directory 

**Error code: `ZE10011`**
**Location**: Terminal 
**Related plugins**: all
After we recursively loop for the current working directory where the bundler's config lives and locate the `package.json` file, we then perform a parsing function to make sure your `package.json` is a valid [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format. 

If the `package.json` we located is not in a valid JSON format (hey your npm script or dependencies installation will fail if it is not), we will throw the `Error [ZE10020]: package.json {path} is not valid json.`


## Debugging the error 

Although it's unlikely, do make sure your `package.json`'s format is in correct JSON format.
