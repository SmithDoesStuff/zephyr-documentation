# `package.json` not found from current directory 

**Error code: `ZE10010`**

This method is implemented across all bundlers' plugins (see our [supported bundlers and their relevant packages](/guide/supported)). 

When we start the deployment process after your build, we first look for a `package.json` file in current directory (the same level) where bundler's configuration file lives based on your bundler's configuration and if not - we will find your current working directory ourselves. How we find your `package.json` file could be determined by two factors: 

1. Data we cached on your local machine for this specific project in `~/.zephyr` folder, if you have built from this directory. 

2. If the above method failed to locate your `package.json` path, we will then recursively look for a `package.json` file in the parent directory of the current one, and keep going one level up until we find a match. 

## Debugging the error 

Ensure that there is one `package.json` file within either the directory where bundler's configuration lives, or it's parent one. 

## Example folder structure

```
- node_module
- src
  - app
- vite.config.ts
- tailwind.config.ts
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- tsconfig.json

```
