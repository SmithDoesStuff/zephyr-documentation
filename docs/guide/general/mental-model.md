# Mental Model

Think of Zephyr Cloud as the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for front-end development. Although not a perfect comparison, it closely aligns with its functionality.

## Instant Gratification

Organizations frequently use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and [zrok](https://zrok.io/) to quickly share a local development environment with team members. These tools create a tunnel from the developer's machine to the end user, facilitating real-time collaboration.

In contrast, Zephyr Cloud takes a different approach by publishing a snapshot of the development to the cloud with every save. This allows end users to access the code even after the developer has closed their local environment. Moreover, with Zephyr snapshots, it's possible to observe the evolution of software across each iteration.
