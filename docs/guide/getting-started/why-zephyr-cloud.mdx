# Why Zephyr Cloud

[//]: # (We need to create a video for this part of the docs)

We developed Zephyr Cloud in response to recurring questions from our clients about deploying federated applications and best practices for developing and deploying micro-frontends.

Zephyr represents our second attempt at addressing these challenges, following our initial platform, [Medusa](https://medusa.codes/).

As we expanded Zephyr Cloud, we realized that it was enhancing productivity across all sites, not just in federated environments.

## How Zephyr Enhances Your Operations

Zephyr helps to: **speed up your software development lifecycle** (e.g. local development, CI/CD, QA Testing, Deployment),
**increase collaboration** and **increase iteration speed**.

You can use Zephyr to:
* Deploy more rapidly to your existing public cloud account
* Manage version control for your frontend
* Improve or gain visibility into the connectivity of your micro-frontends
