# Roadmap

Our roadmap is dynamic, yet we strive to transparently share our planned milestones as much as possible.

## Alpha 1

**Target Launch Date:** April 1, 2024 *(not a joke)*

### Cloud Support

- Zephyr Cloud will initially support built-in cloud services only.

### Goals

- The primary objective of this phase is to validate our capacity to onboard an initial wave of users, including content creators and developer relations professionals. This phase aims to conceptually demonstrate the effectiveness of Zephyr Cloud, even though it does not yet support bring-your-own-cloud options.

## Alpha 2

**Target Launch Date:** April 22, 2024

### Cloud Support

- Integration with Cloudflare and AWS.
- 
### Goals

- This phase will focus on implementing Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) capabilities as more complex proof of concepts are developed. BYOC is crucial for many organizations and is integral to our envisioned developer experience.

## Alpha 3

**Target Launch Date:** May 6, 2024

### Cloud Support

- Expansion to include Netlify and Vercel.

### Goals

- Further goals will be defined as the phase approaches, with a continued emphasis on expanding cloud support.

## Alpha 4

**Target Launch Date:** May 20, 2024

### Cloud Support

- Addition of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Azure, and options for self-hosted clouds (unmanaged).

### Goals

- Detailed objectives for this phase will be determined as development progresses, focusing on broadening cloud support.
